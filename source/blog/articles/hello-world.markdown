##**Who am I?**

I am Fayimora Femi-Balogun, a 20 year old Computer Scientist. As you might have already guessed,
I'm a *[technophile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technophilia)*. I also **LOVE** programming. I
wrote my first program(Hello World in Java) on the 28th of September 2010.

Since then I have learnt a few more languages and paradigms, written a boat load of games and small
apps, participated in numerous programming contests, contributed to Open Source projects, worked at
Goldman Sachs where I developed and maintained software. I've also been teaching programming(amongst
other things) at my University since 2011(my 2nd year). Yes I'm that good :)

##**Why am I blogging?**

Initially, I just wanted to have a blog. You know, everyone was blogging but after a while, I
realised I actually had a lot to offer. A blog isn't just where you write your controversial rants
but also a place where you can share useful knowledge to the society.  In addition, I have come to
realise that by explaining things to people, I learn better and quicker.

A few friends have tried to get me to start blogging but I have been quite reluctant to do so. I
chucked it up to laziness but really, I didn't think I had what it took to be a good blogger. But
then how can I know that if I don't try right? So here I am!

##**What will I be writing about?**

Pretty much everything to be honest. Of course they'll mostly be about geeky and nerdy stuff like
Programming, Machine Learning, Raspberry Pis and some tips I find particularly useful when working
on various project. Nonetheless, I will write about general stuff once in a while.

##**Feedback**

Aside from the fact that I now believe I have a lot to offer and have what it takes to blog, I also
want to learn from you! Sometimes, you might not agree with my methods. In such cases, please leave
a comment and we can ponder on it. I may be wrong or we may just end up realising, yet again, that
there are many ways to skin a cat :)

Ok that's it for now. See you in the upcoming posts.
