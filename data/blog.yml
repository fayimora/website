  Hi, I'm Fayi and I'll be writing about Computer Science related topics. For the less techy folks,
  I will be writing a few reviews and thoughts on certain technologies.

  By the way, I am happy to recieve suggestions. I'll gladly cook up something nice if I can. Just
  tweet at me or send me an email. Of course, *constructive* critism is very welcome
  too!
